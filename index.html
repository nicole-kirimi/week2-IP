       <p>This is an application that takes your birthday and calculates the day
         of the week you were born and then depending on your gender outputs their Akan Name.
        </p>

      <p> Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given
         their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
